# Electrostatic-Sandbox

## Preface:
An electronic monstrosity workstation designed to examine and develop systems for distributed simulations by providing an integrated environment housing the basic nostalgic communication protocols (i.e., Serial and Parallel COMs), the abstract networking interfaces, and a range of other electronics modules providing standards for controller interfaces, and sensor modules (e.g., the underdeveloped ShiftAvr, and Arduinos).

## Software specification overview:

| Item | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| _Problem Definition_ | Obtaining an integrated environment to efficiently integrate embedded systems with other resources like graphics-based applications and games, with an essential predicate of providing the blend of the old communication protocols, and external pluggable electronic modules. |
| _Scientific Recall of the Problem_ | Using the _Set Theory_ and the _Group Theory_, envision the environment to build is a universe set _E_ with a main board known as _GA_, and a set of peripherals _P_, and a set of external electronic modules _M_; thus the final model will be `
| _General Approach_ | 
| _Draw Backs of the General Approach_ |
| _Specific Minimal Approach_ |
| _Upgrading the system_ | 
| _Scientific Recall of the solution_ |
